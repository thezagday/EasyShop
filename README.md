# EasyShop - Optimal routes for shopping
EasyShop is a young startup that helps people to spend their time efficiently inside a big store.

The idea is simple: we create store maps and add them to the project. A person logs into the app, selects the store they are currently in and enters their grocery list. EasyShop builds an optimal route based on this list. As a result: a person does not spend a lot of time to find this or that product in a store he is unfamiliar with.


**Functionality**

Create and maintain store maps: using [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) framework, [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) library, and [React-Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) I want to create maps and add them to the system.  

Search and optimal route planning: EasyShop application allows customers to find the optimal shopping route according to their needs. Users can specify the products they are interested in and select a store, and the app will automatically create an optimal route, taking into account the location of the products in the store.

In-store navigation: EasyShop provides in-store navigation to make it easy for shoppers to find the right departments and products.


**Perspectives**

Functionality development: Our team is actively working on the development of EasyShop application functionality. We plan to add new features, improve routing and navigation algorithms, and introduce innovative technologies to improve user experience.

Expansion of partner network: We aim to cooperate with various stores to provide users with more options and up-to-date information about product locations.

Support for different platforms: We plan to create an EasyShop app for different platforms, including a web version, iOS and Android mobile apps, and integration with smart devices and virtual reality.
